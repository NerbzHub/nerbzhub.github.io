							<p>S-Burn was created during the second game jam we did at AIE. It was 2 and a half days. The aim of the game is to get the escape pod 
								safely on to the ground, avoiding obstacles and landing at a safe speed. You can burn fuel to slow you down but don't use it all 
								before the ground or else you'll come in too fast and explode. This was chosen as one of the Top Picked
								games from the jam by the teachers.<br>
								The name came about from the team's love of Kerbal Space Program and there is a technique of landing called a "Suicide Burn", 
								which is coming in to land at full speed then burning all of your fuel to slow down at the very end.<br>
								<br>This was a fun one to do because it was on mobile and it the first time
								I had ever created a shuffle bag system. The way the game works is that all of the obstacles are moving up the scene and procedurally
								generated based off pre-created chunks. There was a buffer of 2 chunks below and 1 above and the chunks were pseudo-randomly picked out of
								the shuffle bag. After x amount of chunks spawned, the ground chunk spawns. The player must be going at below x speed or else they explode.<br>
								<br> I did majority of the code in this one, the only parts I didn't do was the touch swiping for mobile(one of the designers had done
								the code before and since it was a jam we just plugged that in), space to ground slider on the left, keyboard input and player collision.
