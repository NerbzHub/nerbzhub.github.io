							<p>Backyard Snowdown was created from a 6 week group project to simulate an indie game dev environment. It included GDD,
								<a href"DownloadableFiles/TDD/TDD_BackyardSnowdown.pdf" download >TDD</a>, scrums, daily stand ups, 
								a post-mortem, presentations in front of peers and industry professionals.<br>After manic brainstorming, we decided on “A snowball fight through 
								the eyes of a kid.” And to round it off I came up with the name Backyard Snowdown. I’ve found that a good name in the planning phase 
								creates excitement to create the game because you almost owe it to the title to create a great game.<br>Once the game had finished beta and 
								entered gold, we created a trailer for the game, which is featured below.<br><br>

								One of the cool aspects of the game is the level randomisation. The way I implemented it was the obstacles and ground had multiple 
								variants as different scenes and the environment and players were in a base scene. We then used SceneLoadASync to load both scenes
								on top of each other so that it looks like one but the level changes pseudo-randomly.<br><br>

								In regards to what I coded, since it was two of us and working so closely for 6 weeks, we did a lot of pair programming. If one was stuck,
								the other would help. This does make it a bit harder to distinguish what is mine but we wrote authors on the top of the scripts so we knew
								who worked on what. Although there were still some aspects of the game that were completely me. <br>
								These include:<br>
								<br>- All of the UI and UI Canvas functionality.
								<br>- All of the audio.
								<br>- Scene management.
								<br>- All of the Menu.
								<br>- Charge Shot Visual Cue.
								<br>- Score and Health<br>
